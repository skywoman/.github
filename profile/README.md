# Skywoman Design & Tech Incubator
We're a group of engineers, designers and farmers making better tools to feed people, as a part of the broader [Skywoman](https://skywoman.community) community.

## Get involved
We do not have any regularly scheduled general assemblies for the time being, while we regroup from a short hiatus, but feel free to introduce yourself in the [`#design_tech_incubator`](https://discord.gg/HvXdzdeaW9) channel on the Skywoman Discord! You can also checkout some of the repositories below for ongoing projects.

We used this [kanban](https://github.com/orgs/skywoman/projects/1) once to track projects and opportunities for community contributions, but never came back to it. If there's something that interests you, feel free to pick it up! There's also a collection of [meeting notes from previous meetings](https://github.com/skywoman/about/tree/main/notes).

If you have trouble accessing any information or a repository in this organization, please contact [one of us](https://github.com/orgs/skywoman/people?query=role%3Aowner).
